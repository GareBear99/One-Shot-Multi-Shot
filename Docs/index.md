## ARC-Core mapping

Every market tick becomes an *event*; every trade decision becomes a *proposal*;
every fill or outcome becomes a *receipt*; every risk limit is an *authority
gate*; every backtest is a *deterministic replay* of the event log. Full per-bot
mapping in [ECOSYSTEM.md](https://github.com/GareBear99/ARC-Core/blob/main/ECOSYSTEM.md#-trading-fleet--six-repos-one-event-spine).
